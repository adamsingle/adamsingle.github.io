Here you├óÔé¼Ôäóll find a collection of links to resources that I have found useful or interesting as a game developer, programmer or indie (or any combination of those things).

#### Developer:

[IndieBits](http://www.Indiebits.com "IndieBits") ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ A fantastic site from Epona Schweer, a talented young woman dedicated to discovering, experimenting and sharing insight and advice specifically for Creatives who want to make a living doing what they love.

[#AltDevBlogADay](http://www.altdevblogaday.com/ "AltDevBlogADay") ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ A site that hosts guest blog posts from a large array of talented industry professionals on all areas of game/software development. Also the linked to #AltDevConf a professional quality developers conference that happens entirely online, very handy for those of us that live on the wrong side of the planet for most conferences.

[News for Interactive Developers](http://www.scoop.it/t/news-for-the-interactive-developer-scene) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ A nice collection of blog posts and articles of interest to game developers all in one place.

[Amit Patel](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ a massive, massive resource. An oldschool feeling website with page after page on all things game development, including various programming and AI topics.

[The Ultimate Complete Final Social Media Cheat Sheet](http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2012/11/12/final-social-media-sizing-cheat-sheet/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ Current as of the end of 2012, this page shows the pixel dimensions and character limit of every postable/editable thing on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn and Pinterest. Very handy resource.

[Indie Pitch Deck](http://www.bubbleguminteractive.com/news/pitch-deck-for-indie-games-developers/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ This is a template for creating a quality game pitch. It was put together by Bubblegum Interactive, and I├óÔé¼Ôäód encourage you to explore the rest of their blog also.

[Ramblings in Valve Time](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ The blog of Michael Abrash. If you├óÔé¼Ôäóre a programmer and don├óÔé¼Ôäót know who Michael Abrash is, you should look him up. A great blog discussing some of the things Valve are up to. It├óÔé¼Ôäós always worth knowing what Valve are up to.

#### Game Design:

[Game Tycoon](http://www.edery.org/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ The blog of David Edery, CEO of SpryFox.

Lost Garden ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ The blog of Daniel Cook, CCO of SpryFox. A prolific blog on all things game design. Many, many treasures to be found in here.

[Blocky Pixel Studios](http://www.blockypixel.com/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ The official blog of Blocky Pixel Studios. This blog has a fantastic tendency to analyse existing games, or specific aspects of existing games, discussing why they worked or didn├óÔé¼Ôäót.

[Principles of Virtual Sensation](http://www.steveswink.com/principles-of-virtual-sensation/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ A great post discussing player response to virtual sensations and how to create them to best effect. I highly recommend checking out the rest of Steve├óÔé¼Ôäós page, including Tune: A game about game design.

├é┬á

#### Tutorials:

[3DBuzz](http://www.3dbuzz.com/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ A very cool site full of free tutorials for many different pieces of software including Unity3D.

[GameDevTutes+](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ A phenomenal site that pulls together tutorials on so many different and specific topics on game dev. I have never opened that page and not been sucked into the tutorials.

[AIGameDev](http://aigamedev.com/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ This one is a mixed bag. It├óÔé¼Ôäós not all tutorials, some of it is articles. They do a lot of live casts with some very talented AI programmers, but unfortunately these are very early in the morning in Australia and hard to catch. There is also a lot more content behind a paywall that as an indie I just can├óÔé¼Ôäót afford. No matter how badly I want to.

[Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ A scary number of tutorials on many varying dev topics, including multiple engines and languages.

#### Extras:

[Game Launched](http://gamelaunched.com/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ A fantastic new crowd source service specifically for games. It├óÔé¼Ôäós completely international, has a marketplace for selling funded games and has put together a Launch Team that consists of gaming experts, writers and personalities that you gain access to for advice and guidance.

[Worms World Saga](http://www.wormworldsaga.com/) ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ Purely an inspiration thing. This is an amazingly beautiful web comic with an innovative approach to it├óÔé¼Ôäós layout. Can├óÔé¼Ôäót help but feel inspired to create something beautiful after seeing this.
