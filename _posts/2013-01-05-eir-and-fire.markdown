Valkyrie is the latest, and most ambitious, game from Bifrost Studios. Our first leap into 3D (if you don├óÔé¼Ôäót count the unreleased Dino Diner), it presented us with many, many challenges. Valkyrie is a first person runner set in the world of Norse Mythology, but somewhere in our own future, after the Ragnarok.

This game, like Dino Diner, went through many design changes. With the addition of Oscar Guillen to the Bifrost team, Valkyrie is definitely the most beautiful game we did. I finished up with Bifrost just before the completion of this game.

Below is some concept art and the official trailer.
