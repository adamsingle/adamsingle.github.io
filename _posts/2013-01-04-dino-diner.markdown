Dino Diner is the game that may never be. This was originally Bifrost Studios follow on from Zombie Juice. I wrote this game to ├óÔé¼┼ônear completion├óÔé¼┬Ø twice yet it├óÔé¼Ôäós current status is in the ├óÔé¼┼ôpre production design├óÔé¼┬Ø phase. It├óÔé¼Ôäós a great concept with a lot of potential. Our problem is we kept, learning as we went and didn├óÔé¼Ôäót have the experience to just call it. The more we did this, the more we realised we were approaching it wrong, or making too many wrong decisions. So the game would be pulled back to the ground and we├óÔé¼Ôäód start it again.

I have every confidence that if it was ever made, it├óÔé¼Ôäód be a great little game.
