Today my situation changed. Due to circumstances outside my control, I will unfortunately have to leave Bifrost Studios around March. I├óÔé¼Ôäóm hoping to still get Photon 2 done before I go, as well as release Valkyrie (previously Eir and Fire). So now, more than ever, I feel the need to get to work on my transformation. Especially the academic side of things. I need to start learning more about programming. More about Unity3D in particular. It├óÔé¼Ôäós my strongest skill, but there is so much more I could learn about the engine.

But I said I would address a workout program as well as a course today. Figure out my plan. So first of all, physical conditioning.

I already run three times a week. I├óÔé¼Ôäóve been looking for a strength training routine for the other nights. [Convict Conditioning](http://adamsingle.com/nerd-fitness-and-my-inner-super-hero/ "Nerd Fitness and my inner super hero")├é┬ágave me that. So here├óÔé¼Ôäós my week.

Monday Push-ups and Leg Raises

Tuesday Run

Wednesday Pullups and Squats

Thursday Run

Friday Headstand Pushups and Bridges

Saturday Run

Sunday Sleep. Maybe.

For progress mapping, I├óÔé¼Ôäóll start a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqlPu7zxDX-mdHVFQlMxQmZTT0xwTTVudl9RRkh6VXc "Spider-Man Transformation Training Progress"). This will show the actual exercise I├óÔé¼Ôäóm performing on each of the above days. For instance a Push-up is actually the 5th step in the Push-up sequence that ends with one armed push-ups. So for the first month at least I├óÔé¼Ôäóll be doing simple Wall Push-ups.

Now, academically, I need to have an approach that is flexible. I├óÔé¼Ôäóve decided to re-read my C# Class Design Handbook. A fantastic book for any programmer or anyone learning to program, especially if they├óÔé¼Ôäóll be using C# specifically. But what I├óÔé¼Ôäóm going to do this time is apply the [Drill Down](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/10/26/mastering-linear-algebra-in-10-days-astounding-experiments-in-ultra-learning/ "Drill Down Technique")├é┬átechnique I mentioned in the previous post to each chapter. This will be a good test of the technique as well as how to fit it into my daily routine.

So, although it is possible I will not have a job in 2 months time, I am not sitting idly, nor panicking. I will be contacting developers in the Brisbane area, I will utilise social networks and connections I├óÔé¼Ôäóve made over the last 2 years and this website itself will also help. Things will work out. Life is for living, not worrying about. So long as I am constantly working to better myself, I├óÔé¼Ôäóm moving forward. I have some contract work lined up for the year, and I believe I could get more if it came to it.
