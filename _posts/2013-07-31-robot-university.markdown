Robot University is an interactive public display at [QUT├óÔé¼Ôäós The Cube](http://www.thecube.qut.edu.au/ "The Cube"). It is the first Digital Writing Residency in Australia, and it has been awarded to Christy Dena from [Universe Creation 101](http://www.universecreation101.com/ "Universe Creation 101")├é┬áand she has selected me to be the programmer in the team. The cube is a $230 million Science and Technology center. We will be taking advantage of the touch screens and Kinect motion sensors to build a unique experience for the visitors.

To quote Christy:

> The project, provisionally titled ├óÔé¼┼ôRobot University,├óÔé¼┬Ø aims to transform negative attitudes towards robots. Western entertainment often paints robots as killing machines bent on our demise.├é┬áIt├óÔé¼Ôäós important that we consider the cultural impact of robots and how we interact with them now, so that we can better prepare ourselves for our ever-growing community of robots├óÔé¼┬ªa new species we├óÔé¼Ôäóve created.├óÔé¼┬Ø

We are only in the early design stages now, but I hope to add a few development blog posts here as we go along.
