Of Wolf And Man was the game that the Bifrost team made for the Fab 48 Hour Game Jam in 2012. It was our first ever Jam, and we made a lot of mistakes. It was a massive learning experience for us. Our final build was incomplete and buggy. But the concept was a good one and maybe one day we├óÔé¼Ôäóll give it a go for real.

The idea was for a 2D stealth platformer (I├óÔé¼Ôäód just played Mark of the Ninja and was obsessed with it├óÔé¼Ôäós visuals and gameplay). The twist was you were a man who turned into a werewolf when the moon was visible. The werewolf had different movement capabilities to the man, but he also produced more volatile reactions from the npcs. Take a look at the concept art below, let me know what you think.
