Photon is a connect 3 game unlike the others on the app stores. Not tiles, gems or grids here. In photon you must connect coloured discs. These discs bounce and roll of each other creating a chaotic tension. Clear the discs before the screen fills up. In classic mode you keep playing till you can├óÔé¼Ôäót last any longer, while Arcade mode gives you 90 seconds and a fusion meter to achieve maximum points.

Easily the most successful game I├óÔé¼Ôäóve worked on, Photon is a deceptively simple puzzle game in the ├óÔé¼╦£match 3├óÔé¼Ôäó style.├é┬áPhoton was featured on Google Play and has had more than 600 000 downloads. Originally written by a single intern programmer and a single intern artist (and managed by Zanda Mylonas), I acted as mentor, and came through later in production cycle to update and bug fix. Towards the end of my time at Bifrost Studios I got about 80% through a serious update for Photon. In fact, so serious, it├óÔé¼Ôäód probably be a sequel. Whether or not that ever sees release is up to the Bifrost Team now, but I hope so. Really neatened up the experience, opened up the gameplay and made some big improvements to performance.
