Welcome to a brand new development blog. Although this is still my personal website, it will predominantly be a development blog site
for the game I'm currently working on. There may be some technical side posts on interesting techniques or patterns that are designed
to teach other coders something new I've learnt myself, but mostly it will be updates on the game's progress.

This site iteself is a learning process. I'm building it using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosting in on github. I'm hoping for a much more manageable
development process for the blog itself.
